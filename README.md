## Project Status
This project is still being working on. The front end requires extensive rebuilding to make it clean and functional. The backend requires some refactoring.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- My ReactJS requires a lot of work. I plan to re-do the entire frontend using functional components and async/await functions.
- I have a habit of building code for all of the future features I want rather than the MVP. It wastes time and energy.

To do:
- A reminder function for upcoming appointments and follow ups.
